# Family Bakery Website

A simple responsive website built using **HTML** and **CSS** only.  
This project was part of my early training at Root Academy and focused on mastering layout fundamentals.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I learned:
- Using `position: relative / absolute` to control element placement.
- Working with `float` for layout structure (before Flexbox/Grid).
- Understanding the `display` property (block, inline-block, none, etc.).
- Structuring a clean and semantic HTML layout.

## ðŸ’¡ Tools used:

- CSS3
